🍃 There are no markdown files for explanations in tutorial 3 since everything have been commented in the source code. 

**But** there are things you might want to note going further into the course:
- You should know OOP (Object-oriented Programming) quite well starting from now *(since all tutorials and activity now require you to do so)*
- If you find it hard to understand OOP, [here (by BroCode, using Java)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYbi93vuSaU) or [here (by MIT lecturer, using Python)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DP1i2ZU9gk)*(both are in English)*

`- Love you! -`
