# ❓ How to use

##### Refer to
- [./src](https://github.com/manhanbanhcanh/PR2-Summer-2026/tree/master/src) for RAW Java code (only for code-required activities)
- [./markdown](https://github.com/manhanbanhcanh/PR2-Summer-2026/tree/master/markdown) for furnished, fully done activities with explanation (if I feel like it)
- [./pdf (tut files)](https://github.com/manhanbanhcanh/PR2-Summer-2026/tree/master/pdf%20(tut%20files)) for question files (since I found pasting the questions in the source code are not that productive)
