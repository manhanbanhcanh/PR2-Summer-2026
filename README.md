# ☀️ Tutorial files - PR2

This is the directory for my works in Programming 2, Summer 2026. It includes homework, quiz, and tutorial files that have been solved and tested. Some of the files are not perfect, so bug report and branches are welcome. Happy coding 🥮

# ❓ How to use

##### Refer to
- ./src for RAW Java code (only for code-required activities)
- ./markdown for furnished, fully done activities with explaination (if I feel like it)
